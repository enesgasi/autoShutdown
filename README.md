# autoShutdown
A console application that automates pc shutdown. Very useful when you're downloading something from steam and you want to close the pc when the downloading finishes.

## How does it work?
First, you have to select between 3 Functions : shutdown, restart, and cancel.
to do this, you have to press the corresponding number on the keyboard.
Then the program asks you how many minutes after you want the computer to be shut down/restarted .
After that, you're all set. You can cancel the process by using the cancel function

Thanks
